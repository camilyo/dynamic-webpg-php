# dynamic-webpg-php

Adding php to a webpage template to separate the pages of it into header and footer include files to create dynamic content, using a switch statement to change the contents by swappig data in variables. 

It includes page id to identify the current page the user is in and a "daily page" that changes content according to the days of the week and a list/view template that displays 20 records from a MySQL database.

At last, I impementated an administratove area for the website. This area will consist of web pages and files that create a web application that allows administrators to login and view private pages.
